Using the POSIX Threads library, 
implement the following demo program in C.
Three threads simultaneously write characters 
to the standard output without stopping: 
the first thread writes the letter a, 
the second thread writes the letter b, 
the third thread writes the letter c.
Each thread should print exactly 10000 of letters and complete, 
the main thread should wait for the working threads to complete.
Compare if the result is different when using different output methods:

-printf("x");
-write(STDOUT_FILENO, "x", 1).
