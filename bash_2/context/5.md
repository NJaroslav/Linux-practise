It is known that the C++11 standard introduced the std::u16string class for storing strings in UTF-16 encoding,
and the possibility to set string literals in this encoding as u "string".
Suppose that in your project the developers have already converted to UTF-16 strings,
but have not yet begun to use Unicode literals.
To convert strings the following functions are defined:
```
std::u16string ASCIIToWide(const std::string&);
std::u16string UTF8ToWide(const std::string&);
std::u16string Utf16StringFor(const std::string&);
```
(The project is large and old, historically there are several functions, but they do the same thing).
The task before you is to start using newfangled literals and remove unnecessary function calls:
```
// There was
std::u16string s = UTF8ToWide("hello");

//there was
std::u16string s = u "hello";
```
Write a script which will refactor the whole code base.
- ### Input:
The current directory and subdirectories contain the C++ source code (files with cpp and h extensions). 
There may be other files, they do not need to handle. File and directory names may contain spaces.
- ### Output
Perform in-place replacement, that is during processing change existing files. It is not necessary to make backups.
