Strings come in. If the string does not start with http:// or https://, you should add prefix http:// to its beginning.
The resulting (or original, if it already had the right prefix) string is output to the standard stream. 
No assumptions are made about the contents of the strings.

- ### Example:
### standard input:
```
bsu.by
https://acm.bsu.by
```
### standard output:
```
http://bsu.by
https://acm.bsu.by
```
