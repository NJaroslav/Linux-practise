Using the find utility, find all symbolic links in the /etc directory that point to the file /etc/init.d/cron.
If the current user does not have access to any files or directories, they should be ignored. 
No need to use sudo. Do not print any error messages such as "Permission denied."

Output:
Output the absolute paths to the symbolic links in any order, one per line.
