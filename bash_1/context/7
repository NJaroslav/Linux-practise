Write a script called fdcount.sh.
The script takes one argument - the directory path. 
The script outputs the total number of regular files and subdirectories 
in the specified directory (recursively). When counting subdirectories, 
the directory itself is also taken into account. 
There is no need to click on symbolic links.

The output is formatted as shown in the example. 
It is necessary to substitute one or another form 
of the word according to the number of found 
(0 files, 1 file, 2 files).
In order to avoid code duplication, put the logic in a shell function.


Example:
$ ./fdcount.sh .
1 file
1 directory
$ mkdir subdir
$ ./fdcount.sh .
1 file
2 directories
$ touch subdir/file
$ ./fdcount.sh .
2 files
2 directories
