A natural number is prime if it has exactly two natural divisors.
Write a script that takes one argument - a number from 0 to 2^{31}-1 inclusive - 
and determines whether that number is prime. 
If the number is prime, the output code should be 0, 
otherwise 1.

Example:
$ ./isprime.sh 1; echo $?
1
$ ./isprime.sh 2; echo $?
0
$ ./isprime.sh 3; echo $?
0
$ ./isprime.sh 4; echo $?
1
$ ./isprime.sh 1000000007; echo $?
0
